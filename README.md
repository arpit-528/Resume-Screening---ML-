# Resume Screening App (ML + NLP + Flask)
Automatically analyze resumes and predict the most suitable job role using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.

This project helps recruiters quickly identify the best-fit category (like Data Science, HR, etc.) for a candidate’s resume — saving time and effort during hiring!
